## Preamble
So, you've done a few briefings and read a few articles, done a few challenges, but still don't feel great about your relationship with JavaScript.

How do you get better?

Build things. Lots of things. Build 1,000 things. Keep it up and don't stop. Seriously.

This has always been my advice. Just put in the work and you will get better.

Ideas, Eh? I've got lots! This is JavaScript30 â€” let's build 30 things together.

This briefing aims to make you rediscover Javascript through fun exercises to perform. And also learn new things that you don't already know about. That said, if you want to do a particular exercise before another, you can ! if you want to skip an exercise for another, it's up to you !.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE** : No pressure here, the main goal here is to have FUN while learning Javascript ! Of course, you don't even have to follow all the 30 tutorials. Just do the best you can ! Do as much exercices as you can, the more you do the better you will be !

## The Mission
1. Goto https://courses.wesbos.com/account, register for an account, or ask your coach for his account if you don't want to register. Sign-in.
2. Once you're logged-in, click on the big picture where it's writting "Javascript-30" to start the FUN !
